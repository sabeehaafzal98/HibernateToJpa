 JPA Introduced (2006)
Java Persistence API (JPA) was introduced as part of Java EE 5 (JSR 220).
It was created to standardize ORM in Java, inspired heavily by Hibernate.
Hibernate 3.2+ began to support JPA as a standard interface.
ðŸ”¹ Hibernate Becomes a JPA Provider
Hibernate adapted to become a JPA-compliant provider.
You could now use Hibernate with JPA annotations and APIs, instead of Hibernate-specific XML.
ðŸ”¹ Modern Hibernate (Post Hibernate 5)
Hibernate continues to evolve, but JPA is the preferred interface for most developers.
Hibernate still offers extra features beyond JPA (like interceptors, filters, etc.), but JPA is the standardized, portable way to write persistence logic.
